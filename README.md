# Contact-Book
This is an application containing contact details such as full name, address, email, phone number, visibility of a contact detail in a saved database. 
It also has Insert, Delete, Search and Search by Last Name options.
A database is first set-up and the pathway is linked in the IndividualQuery.java file. 
I made use of WAMP server to locally host my database on my system.
My database was named official_address and the table named person.
The table fields were populated as follows "id", "fname", "lname", "address", "phone", "email", "visible".
